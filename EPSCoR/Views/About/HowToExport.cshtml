<h2>How to export your database from Microsoft Access</h2>

	<pre> Step 1: </pre>
	<p>
        First, open up your associated .accdb database file in Microsoft 
	    Access 2007 or newer, and look for the tables section on the 
	    left side (default)
    </p>

	<pre> Step 2: </pre>
	<p>
	    Right click on the database table you'd like to upload, select "Export", and then select "Text File"
	</p>

    <pre> Step 3: </pre>
    <p>
	    At the output filename prompt, type in the name of your output file (the table name is a good name) and change the
	    .txt filetype to .csv
        <em>*** NOTE ***</em>
        When naming files, it is necessary for you to ensure proper operation by ending all upstream filenames
	    with "_US" before the .csv filetype. Otherwise your uploaded table will be assumed as an attribute table i.e. 
	    if your attribute filename is CC.csv then your upstream filename would be CC_US.csv
    </p>

	<pre> Step 4: </pre>
	<p>
	    After clicking OK, make sure in the next pane that the "Delimited" radio button is selected, and then press Next.
	</p>

    <pre> Step 5: </pre>
	<p>
	    In the next window make sure that the "Comma" radio button is selected, and that the check box next to 
	    "Include Field Names on First Row" is ckecked. Click Next.

    <pre> Step 6 </pre>
	<p>
	    At the last step, check to see that your export file is named correctly and that it has the .csv extension. Click
	    finish and let Access do its job. Once you have exported all the table files you'd like to upload you can proceed
	    to the upload stage.
